### My story

Kis is a sophisticated, statically-typed programming language designed for modern software development needs. Its rich type system supports both primitive and user-defined types, enhanced by advanced features like generics and type inference, allowing developers to write expressive, yet type-safe code. A distinctive feature of Kis is its support for function and operator overloading, enabling context-specific behaviors of functions and operators based on argument types, thereby enhancing the language's flexibility and expressiveness.

Kis also places a strong emphasis on immutability, offering immutable data types to ensure safer and more predictable code, particularly beneficial in concurrent programming scenarios. Furthermore, Kis features a module system, complete with import/export capabilities, encouraging modularity and code reuse. This comprehensive suite of features positions Kis as a powerful tool for developers looking to leverage the benefits of modern language design in both system-level and high-level application development.
